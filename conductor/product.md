# Initial Concept

I am looking to revere engineer, rebuild and improve this application so it can be used to update my sims game to the latest version along with all other content the application can currently download. do deep research into the codebase and other sources if need be to make this work

# Product Guide: Sims 4 Updater Rebuild

## Vision
The goal is to reverse engineer, rebuild, and improve the Sims 4 Updater by anadius. The new application will be a modern, high-performance, and feature-rich tool for updating and repairing *The Sims 4*, providing both ease of use for casual players and granular control for power users.

## Target Audience
- **Casual Players:** Users seeking a simple, automated solution for keeping their game up to date and repaired.
- **Power Users & Modders:** Users requiring detailed control over DLC installations, content verification, and advanced configuration.

## Key Features
- **Modern User Interface:** A clean, intuitive GUI built with modern principles, featuring detailed progress tracking and status reporting.
- **Advanced DLC Management:** Granular selection and management of expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs, and kits.
- **High-Performance Infrastructure:** Implementation of multi-threaded downloading and intelligent delta patching to optimize speed and data usage.

## Technical Strategy & Research
- **Reverse Engineering:** Deep analysis of communication protocols, manifest file formats, and original patching logic.
- **Protocol Analysis:** Interception of network traffic and analysis of server-side APIs used for content delivery.
- **Source Code Audit:** Decompilation and static analysis of the original executable to understand core business logic.
- **Community-Driven Intelligence:** Leveraging research from modding communities (e.g., CS.RIN.RU) to stay aligned with game updates and server changes.

## Success Criteria
The project is successful when a stable, fully functional, and performance-optimized application is delivered that serves as a complete replacement for the original tool, supporting all current and future Sims 4 content.
