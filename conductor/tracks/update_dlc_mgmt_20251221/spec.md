# Track Spec: Update Execution & DLC Management

## Overview
This track implements the logic to execute the update/repair operations identified by the engine and provides a GUI for users to manage their DLCs. It transitions the project from a set of research tools and engines into a functional application.

## Goals
- Implement the "Apply Operations" loop to sequentially download and patch files.
- Build a DLC detection system to identify installed and missing content.
- Create a React-based UI for selecting DLCs and initiating the update process.
- Ensure robust error handling and atomic file operations during the update loop.

## Technical Requirements
- Sequential processing of the `operations` list generated by `UpdateManager`.
- Use the `Patcher.apply_patch_safe` method for all patching operations.
- React state management for DLC checkboxes and download progress.
- IPC communication for "start update" and "dlc status" requests.

## Success Criteria
- The application can process a list of mock operations (download + patch) correctly.
- The UI displays a list of available DLCs with their current status.
- A user can select a missing DLC and trigger its installation through the UI.
