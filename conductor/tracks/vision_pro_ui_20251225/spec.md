# Track Spec: Vision Pro - High-Fidelity UI/UX Reimplementation

## Overview
This track executes a ground-up reimplementation of the application's user interface. It moves beyond basic design to a high-fidelity, "Apple TV/Vision Pro" inspired experience. The focus is on depth, immersion, and professional-grade polish.

## Goals
- **Immersive Depth:** Implement a multi-layered design using advanced glassmorphism and 3D transforms.
- **Magnetic Focus Engine:** Create components that react dynamically to user interaction with scaling, glowing, and rotation.
- **Top-Shelf Navigation:** Transition to a sleek, minimalist top-shelf navigation system.
- **High-Contrast Typography:** Establish a clear information hierarchy using bold display fonts and refined mono-spaced data.
- **Production Performance:** Ensure heavy blurs and animations are optimized for a smooth 60fps experience.

## Technical Requirements
- **Tailwind CSS 4:** Leverage the latest JIT engine for complex design tokens.
- **Framer Motion:** Orchestrate all view transitions and micro-interactions.
- **Custom Parallax Hook:** Implement a robust mouse-tracking hook for 3D card effects.
- **State-Aware Environment:** The background and accent colors should subtly shift based on backend health and operation status.

## Success Criteria
- The application feels premium, like a native VisionOS or Apple TV app.
- All functional features (Intelligence Hub, Resumable Updates) are perfectly integrated.
- Zero compilation errors and passes all high-fidelity UI audits.
