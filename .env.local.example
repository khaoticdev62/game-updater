# Windows Code Signing Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual certificate path and password
# 
# NOTE: .env.local is gitignored - NEVER commit certificate credentials
#
# To set up code signing:
# 1. Obtain a code signing certificate (.pfx file) from a trusted CA
# 2. Store the certificate file securely (e.g., C:\Certificates\code-signing-cert.pfx)
# 3. Copy this file to .env.local and fill in the values below
# 4. Run 'npm run make' to build and sign the installer

# Path to the code signing certificate (.pfx file)
# Example: C:\Certificates\code-signing-cert.pfx
CSC_LINK=

# Password for the code signing certificate
# This is the password you set when creating/exporting the certificate
CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=

# Optional: Timestamp server for signature validation
# Default timestamp servers are configured in scripts/sign-windows.js
# CSC_TIMESTAMP_SERVER=http://timestamp.digicert.com
